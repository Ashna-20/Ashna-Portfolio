# MongoDB & Spotify API Integration: 
Used MongoDB Atlas to store and manage music data retrieved from the Spotify API.

### Project Description: 
This project integrates MongoDB with the Spotify API to implement batch processing and analyze music-related data. It retrieves new release data from Spotify, stores it in MongoDB, and explores albums from featured artists. Additionally, an interactive map is created using Folium for data visualization. 

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- MongoDB
- Spotify API
- Folium

### Steps:

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas client to manage data storage.
2. Create and connect to a Spotify app using the Spotify SDK.
3. Retrieve new release data from the Spotify API.
4. Store and explore the data in MongoDB collections.
5. Analyze albums from featured artists and store relevant data.
6. Build an interactive map using Folium to visualize data.

### Result:
The project successfully integrates Spotify data into MongoDB, processes it efficiently using batch processing techniques, and visualizes key data points on an interactive map.
