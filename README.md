# Credit Scoring Prediction Project

### Project Description:
This project aims to predict financial distress by analyzing historical credit data. Using machine learning, model predicts if a person might struggle to repay their credit. By analyzing past financial data, the model helps banks and lenders make better decisions and reduce risk.

### Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- XGBoost & LightGBM (Boosting Algorithms)

### Steps
1. Loaded the dataset and handled missing values through imputation or removal.
2. Compared different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest.) and trained them with fine-tuned parameters.
3. Evaluated models using metrics like AUC-ROC, accuracy, and precision to select the best performer.
4. Post-Processing & Bias Mitigation

### Result: 
The model have good predictive performance

# Restaurant Recommendation System

### Project Description:
This project uses Yelp data to build a restaurant recommendation system. It uses machine learning to suggest restaurants based on user preferences.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

### Steps:
1. Collect restaurant data using the Yelp API.
2. Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
4. Visualize the results using Matplotlib.

### Result:
The model successfully suggests restaurants based on user preferences and ratings.

# MongoDB & Spotify API Integration: 
Used MongoDB Atlas to store and manage music data retrieved from the Spotify API.

### Project Description: 
This project integrates MongoDB with the Spotify API to implement batch processing and analyze music-related data. It retrieves new release data from Spotify, stores it in MongoDB, and explores albums from featured artists. Additionally, an interactive map is created using Folium for data visualization. 

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- MongoDB
- Spotify API
- Folium

### Steps:

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas client to manage data storage.
2. Create and connect to a Spotify app using the Spotify SDK.
3. Retrieve new release data from the Spotify API.
4. Store and explore the data in MongoDB collections.
5. Analyze albums from featured artists and store relevant data.
6. Build an interactive map using Folium to visualize data.

### Result:
The project successfully integrates Spotify data into MongoDB, processes it efficiently using batch processing techniques, and visualizes key data points on an interactive map.
